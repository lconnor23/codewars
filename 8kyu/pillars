// There are pillars near the road. The distance between the pillars is the same and the width of the pillars is the same. Your function accepts three arguments:

// number of pillars (â‰¥ 1);
// distance between pillars (10 - 30 meters);
// width of the pillar (10 - 50 centimeters).
// Calculate the distance between the first and the last pillar in centimeters (without the width of the first and last pillar).

// My Solution
function pillars(numPill, dist, width) {
  //width of # of pillars -2
  //distance x # of pillars -1
  return numPill > 1 ? (numPill - 2)*width + (numPill - 1)*dist*100 : 0
}
