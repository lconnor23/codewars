// DESCRIPTION:
// Given a month as an integer from 1 to 12, return to which quarter of the year it belongs as an integer number.

// For example: month 2 (February), is part of the first quarter; month 6 (June), is part of the second quarter; and month 11 (November), is part of the fourth quarter.

//My solution
const quarterOf = (month) => {
    if (month < 4){
      return 1
    }else if (month < 7){
      return 2
    }else if (month < 10){
      return 3
    }else {
      return 4
    } 
  }

  //Other solution
  const quarter = (month) => {
    return month < 4 ? 1 : month < 7 ? 2 : month < 10 ? 3 : 4;
  }
