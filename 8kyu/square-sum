// Complete the square sum function so that it squares each number passed into it and then sums the results together.

// For example, for [1, 2, 2] it should return 9 because 1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 = 9.

//My solution
function squareSum(arr){
    const square = arr.map(a => a*a)
    return square.reduce((a, b) => a +b)
  }

//Other
//My solution above didn't work because it was missing zero as an initial value. When used in the reduce method as the third parameter, it's specifies the initial value.
function squareSum(numbers){
    return numbers.reduce((sum,num) => sum + (num * num), 0);
