// Complete the function, which calculates how much you need to tip based on the total amount of the bill and the service.

// You need to consider the following ratings:

// Terrible: tip 0%
// Poor: tip 5%
// Good: tip 10%
// Great: tip 15%
// Excellent: tip 20%
// The rating is case insensitive (so "great" = "GREAT"). If an unrecognised rating is received, then you need to return:

// "Rating not recognised" in Javascript, Python and Ruby...
// ...or null in Java
// ...or -1 in C#
// Because you're a nice person, you always round up the tip, regardless of the service.

// My solution
function calculateTip(amount, rating) {
  //make object with tip and percentage written in decimal
  let tip = {
    "terrible": 0,
    "poor": .05,
    "good": .10,
    "great": .15,
    "excellent": .20
  }
  rating = rating.toLowerCase()
  //return Math.ceil(amount * rating) || message
  let result = Math.ceil(tip[rating] * amount)
  return result >= 0 ? result : "Rating not recognised"
}
