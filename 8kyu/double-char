// Given a string, you have to return a string in which each character (case-sensitive) is repeated once.

// Examples (Input -> Output):
// * "String"      -> "SSttrriinngg"
// * "Hello World" -> "HHeelllloo  WWoorrlldd"
// * "1234!_ "     -> "11223344!!__  "

//My solution
function doubleChar(str) {
    let double = ''
    for (i = 0; i < str.length; i++){
      double += str[i] + str[i]
    } return double
  }

  //I tried using .split .map .join but couldn't get the syntax quite right so I went with a loop thinking .map the problem was the methods I used rather than the syntax. I thought I had to write the string name before each method, but you only need it once in the beginning. One solution used these methods, so I went back and solved it again with the following solution:
  function doubleChar(str) {
    return str.split('').map(a => a + a).join('')  
  }
