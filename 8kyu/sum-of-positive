// You get an array of numbers, return the sum of all of the positives ones.

// Example [1,-4,7,12] => 1 + 7 + 12 = 20

// Note: if there is nothing to sum, the sum is default to 0.

//My solution
function positiveSum(arr) {
    let sum = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
    if (arr[i] > 0 ){
      sum += arr[i]
    }
  }return sum
  }

  //Another method
  //0 is the initial value assigned at the end, so we don't have to find out if a is positive because it's 0.
  function positiveSum(arr) {
    return arr.reduce((a,b)=> a + (b > 0 ? b : 0),0);
