// Sentence Smash
// Write a function that takes an array of words and smashes them together into a sentence and returns the sentence. You can ignore any need to sanitize words or add punctuation, but you should add spaces between each word. Be careful, there shouldn't be a space at the beginning or the end of the sentence!

// Example
// ['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'great']  =>  'hello world this is great'

//My solution
function smash (words) {
    let sentence = ''
     for(let i = 0; i < words.length; i++){
       if (i <words.length - 1){
       sentence += words[i] + ' '
      }else sentence += words[i]     
     }return sentence
  };

//Much simpler solution
function smash (words) {
    return words.join(" ")
 };
