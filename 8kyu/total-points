// Our football team has finished the championship.

// Our team's match results are recorded in a collection of strings. Each match is represented by a string in the format "x:y", where x is our team's score and y is our opponents score.

// For example: ["3:1", "2:2", "0:1", ...]

// Points are awarded for each match as follows:

// if x > y: 3 points (win)
// if x < y: 0 points (loss)
// if x = y: 1 point (tie)
// We need to write a function that takes this collection and returns the number of points our team (x) got in the championship by the rules given above.

// Notes:

// our team always plays 10 matches in the championship
// 0 <= x <= 4
// 0 <= y <= 4

//My solution
function points(games) {
    let x = 0
    for (let i = 0; i < games.length; i++){
      if(games[i][0] > games[i][2]){
        x += 3
      }else if(games[i][0] === games[i][2]){
        x++
      }
    }
    return x
  }
