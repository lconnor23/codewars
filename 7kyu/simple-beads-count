// DESCRIPTION:
// Two red beads are placed between every two blue beads. There are N blue beads. After looking at the arrangement below work out the number of red beads.

// @ @@ @ @@ @ @@ @ @@ @ @@ @

// Implement count_red_beads(n) (in PHP count_red_beads($n); in Java, Javascript, TypeScript, C, C++ countRedBeads(n)) so that it returns the number of red beads.
// If there are less than 2 blue beads return 0.

// My solution
function countRedBeads(n) {
  return n < 2 ? 0 : (n - 1)*2
