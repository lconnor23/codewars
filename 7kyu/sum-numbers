// Due to another of his misbehaved, the primary school's teacher of the young GauÃŸ, Herr J.G. BÃ¼ttner, to keep the bored and unruly young schoolboy Karl Friedrich Gauss busy for a good long time, while he teaching arithmetic to his mates, assigned him the problem of adding up all the whole numbers from 1 through a given number n.

// Your task is to help the young Carl Friedrich to solve this problem as quickly as you can; so, he can astonish his teacher and rescue his recreation interval.

// Here's, an example:

// f(n=100) // returns 5050 
// It's your duty to verify that n is a valid positive integer number. If not, please, return false (None for Python, null for C#, 0 for COBOL).

// My solution
function f(n){
//check that n is positive integer
//use sum of integers to return sum, else return false
  return n > 0 && Number.isInteger(n) ? n*(1 + n)/2 : false
};
