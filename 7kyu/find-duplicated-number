// You are given an array of n+1 integers 1 through n. In addition there is a single duplicate integer.

// The array is unsorted.

// An example valid array would be [3, 2, 5, 1, 3, 4]. It has the integers 1 through 5 and 3 is duplicated. [1, 2, 4, 5, 5] would not be valid as it is missing 3.

// You should return the duplicate value as a single integer.

// My solution
function findDup( arr ){
  arr = arr.sort((a, b) => a - b)
  console.log(arr)
  for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
    if(arr[i] === arr[i + 1]){
    return arr[i]
  }
}
  }
