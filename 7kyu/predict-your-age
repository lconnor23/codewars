// My grandfather always predicted how old people would get, and right before he passed away he revealed his secret!

// In honor of my grandfather's memory we will write a function using his formula!

// Take a list of ages when each of your great-grandparent died.
// Multiply each number by itself.
// Add them all together.
// Take the square root of the result.
// Divide by two.
// Example
// predictAge(65, 60, 75, 55, 60, 63, 64, 45) === 86

// My Solution
function predictAge(age1,age2,age3,age4,age5,age6,age7,age8){
  let ages = [age1,age2,age3,age4,age5,age6,age7,age8]
  let squared = ages.map(e => e**2)
  return Math.floor(Math.sqrt(squared.reduce((a, b) => a + b)) / 2)
