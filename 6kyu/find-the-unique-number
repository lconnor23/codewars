// There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!

// findUniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) === 2
// findUniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) === 0.55
// It’s guaranteed that array contains at least 3 numbers.

// The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.

//My solution
function unique(arr){
  arr.sort()
  if ((arr[0] != arr[1]) && arr[0] != arr[2]){
    return arr[0]
  }else{
    return arr[arr.length-1]
  }
}
